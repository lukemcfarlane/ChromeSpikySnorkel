Spiky Snorkel
=============

A Google Chrome extension that applies a number of tweaks to the Salesforce user experience.

Tweaks
------

* Turns "Show more" links into "Show all", e.g. to show all records in a related list.
* Moves Developer Console link out of dropdown menu and into the nav links at the top right-hand corner of page.
* Sorts all select lists alphabetically (case insensitive)
* Shows the Salesforce version name & API version number under the Salesforce logo on top left-hand corner of page

Why the name?
-------------

Look at this snorkel and tell me it isn't spiky:
